## Males Enrollment Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE}
require(rCharts)

data <- read.csv('assets/edu.csv')

h1 <- hPlot(Estimate~Age, data = subset(data, Gender=="Males"), type = c("line", "bubble", "scatter"), group = "College_Enrollment", size="Estimate")

h1$save('assets/img/m1.html',cdn=TRUE)
cat('<iframe src="assets/img/m1.html", width=100%, height=600></iframe>')

#h1$print('chart1')
# The male un-enrollment rate is higher than enrollment, whether the college is private or public. However in the comparison of public and private college enrollment, males prefer to join public colleges.
```

## Female Enrollment Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE}
require(rCharts)
data <- read.csv('assets/edu.csv')

h1 <- hPlot(Estimate~Age, data = subset(data, Gender=="Females"), type = c("line", "bubble", "scatter"), group = "College_Enrollment", size="Estimate")

h1$save('assets/img/f1.html',cdn=TRUE)
cat('<iframe src="assets/img/f1.html", width=100%, height=600></iframe>')                        

# The female un-enrollment rate is higher than enrollment in private/public colleges. However in the comparison of public and private college enrollment, females also prefer to join public colleges.
